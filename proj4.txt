Write a program that takes a reference string and the number
of frames as inputs to simulate page replacement algorithms.

Suppose the maximum length of a reference string is 30 and
there are 5 different numbers of pages. Randomly enter a reference
string through the keyboard, e.g. 2 1 3 4 5 2 3 ..., and enter the
number of frames as inputs.

Compare the number of page faults generated
by the Optimal and LRU algorithms.  If there is a tie, randomly choose one to break the tie. Print out the page replacement process and
you can see how LRU differs from the optimal.
